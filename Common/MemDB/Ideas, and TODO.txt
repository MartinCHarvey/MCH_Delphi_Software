MemDB: TODO and notes.

TODO: Decide what to do with these silly assertions:
-            RV := PStruct.OutList.AddItem(LatestField, IRecAdd);
-            Assert(RV in [rvOk, rvDuplicateKey]);

TODO: review mem alloc on rollback path?

TODO: Find out why validate FK stuff so slow. Building indexes?

2. Blob handling - do memcopies properly.
    Testapp for basic blob handling.

3. Need a case insensitive comparison for string indexes.

(FK not allowed on case insensitive index).

4. Yeah, go,on. Allow a memcmp for indexing on blobs,
     provided blobdata small (hash etc?).

5. Composite ops.

- Revisit the naming / renaming of entities indexes and fields
  - Rename / rename clashes.
  - Rename / delete clashes.
  - Resolved same way at all levels?

  - What is retryable?
  - When things related, determining which changes are "real" changes,
    and which are implicit renames as a result of other stuff going on.

- Composite ops.
  - Do some things (eg change field type?) with create and then
    rename.
  - How much can we solve things by creating new/old versions of things,
    (indexes / fields / tables) and then renaming things around?

6a. Support mini transactions and changesets
    - To Journal has optional inverse for all journalling funcs.
    - Streamable now needs "Same" (as before) and also needs
      "Am inverse".

    - Revisit streaming of changesets in xactions. Used to be 1:1,
      but we now need multiple changesets per transaction.

    - Revisit UserCommitCycle / UserRollback Cycle.
      - MiniCommit?
      - Need to keep track of where we are in Xaction.
      - For writing to journal only stream proverses,
      - For distrib to other machines poss also stream inverses?

    - Revisit all API functions with respect to which are auto-retryable
      after a mini-commit.

      Types of conflicts to consider:
      - Multiple renames. (Disallow after mini-commit implemented).
      - Rename / delete conflicts (Disallow after mini-commit implemented).
      - If implement change field type / change attrs / etc
        - disallow changes if metadata changes already present?

    - Handling of mini-commit failure.

    - Journalling: Backward compatibility for mini-changesets versus current changeset
      functionality.

    - Journalling: Revisit auto-batching of multi changesets into files.

6b.
   - Have a composite API (hangs off DB), which can be used manually.
     - Does more complicated in-place changes, e.g.
       - Change field type?
       - Modify ops, which are actually a copy with multi-renames.
       - Editing of indexes (actually copy / rename / deletecopy).

     See if can wrap composite API into "normal" API functions.

   - And revisit all exceptions, and allow auto-retry of API functions.
     Possibly something in Xaction mode?

- N.B. temporary index stage not strictly required for table field rearrangement.
  We could just change the structure and the tags and run with it.
  However, keep current permanent / temp for "safety" / "checking".
  Consider for optimisation later.

3b. Will handle more complex index/table rearrangements via some "extra-api"
    that we put on top of existing API's.
    - Will require support for "mini-commits" and "retryable" ops, which
      we can do in due course.

3. Further parallelisation on DB load. Not only tables in parallel but indexes parallel.
   May need to seperate out between Main indexed store, and parallel indexed stores for indices.

Suggestions:

- Don't use threadpool, because possibility of deadlocks / starvation, spawn threads.
- Now that you are subclassing TIndexedStore, have asycnhronous index add operations,
  where you can do all the adds, and wait - spawn a thread for each index you need to build.

So:
  - Spawn threads as currently for entity precommit / commit at very initial journal replay.
    (From Scratch and journal replay).
  - Spawn threads in async index store class.

  - Note that to get benefit of this, would be nice to checkpoint and have a big dbinit file
    to start with.

3b. "Retryable":
    - Mini changesets in xactions, auto-retry of multi rename conflicts,
      metadata / data conflicts, &c. &c.

4. SQL / TSQL query engine.

8. Transaction handling can be improved: nested calls to start transaction - solving that is easy(ish),
   but more complicatedly, allowing multiple write transactions in progress at the same time,
   which requires a rethink to the buffering model.

Actually, it's pretty doable, and with finer grained locking as well.

Instead of current / next we have:

current (tbl/rowid/etc) + generation_count (not streamed).
        - possible next (ref transaction/minicommit) (gen_count_cloned_from)
        - possible next (ref transaction/minicommit) (gen_count_cloned_from)
        - possible next (ref transaction/minicommit) (gen_count_cloned_from)

Rollbacks do not decrement gen-counts? Mini-commit multi-transaction rollbacks
db is not necessarily the same as it was in a previous generation count,
"unrelated" (or seemingly unrelated) changes have occured in the DB since,

so you'd have to rollback a/b changes, and then attempt to immediately
apply *and commit* "inverse" changesets, before anyone else changed the
generation counts. That might still require a big MRSW lock, which would
then be the "commit-rollback lock". No-one else would be allowed
to commit changes whilst you wanted to do a rollback.

In pre-commit, we check the gen_counts, and if wrong, abort the transaction.

Can then have per-entity and per-row locking.

Leave this for later after composite API, and SQL engine.

It *is* doable, but it's tricky. Might require retries at higher levels.
