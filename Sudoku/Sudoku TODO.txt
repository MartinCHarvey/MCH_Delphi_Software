1. Compare solver with fastest currently available.

- Not bad - within 5x of the fastest, and it's portable.

2. Re-read paper.

3. OK new plan.

a) Ditch graph symmetry code.
b) Use an algorithm based on counting cells in stacks and bands / rows cols etc to narrow search tree.
c) Find isomorphisms, and categorize existing solutions.
